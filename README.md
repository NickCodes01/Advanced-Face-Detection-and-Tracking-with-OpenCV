# Advanced-Face-Detection-and-Tracking-with-OpenCV
This project implements an advanced real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar cascades. It detects both frontal and profile faces, merging results to improve accuracy through Intersection over Union (IoU) calculations. The application captures video from a webcam, displaying detected faces with bounding boxes in real time.
